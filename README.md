# Symbl Agora iOS Swift Demo App

Symbl.ai is a Conversation Intelligence (CI) platform for developers to build and extend applications capable of understanding natural human conversations at scale. 
Our comprehensive suite of AI/ML products enable developers to easily build and deploy intelligent speech-to-text functionality, extract contextual insights, generate domain-specific insights and intelligence, and access advanced conversation analytics.

By using the Symbl APIs with the Agora iOS Video Call SDK capabilities you benefit from the following out-of-the-box Conversation Intelligence capabilities:

- **Transcription Plus**: Intelligent speech-to-text capabilities, converting speech from a live audio stream and/or video into text and transcripts.

- **Action Items**: Auto detect specific outcomes recognized in a conversation that requires one or more speakers to act on.

- **Follow-ups**: Auto detect follow ups â€” a type of action Item with connotations to follow up a request or a task (e.g. sending an email or making a phone call or booking an appointment or setting up a meeting).

- **Questions**: Auto detect and identify explicit questions or requests for information that comes up during the conversation.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Easily conduct sentiment analysis on any conversation, at the sentence and topic levels.

- **Conversation Topics**: Auto extract and organize all your conversations by topics.

- **Custom Trackers**: Track the occurrences of unique and contextually similar keywords or phrases to identify emerging trends and insights specific to your business and use cases.

- **Conversation Analytics**: Analyze and measure speaker interaction and conversation patterns metrics such as: speaker ratio, talk time, silence, pace, overlap and more.
